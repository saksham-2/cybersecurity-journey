🚀 Google Cybersecurity Course 2: Play It Safe - Manage Security Risks
✅ Module 1: Managing Security Risks
🔍 What is security risk?
Risk is the potential for loss, damage, or destruction of an asset as a result of a threat exploiting a vulnerability.

Typically summarized as:

ini
Copy
Edit
Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact
Example:

If a company has poor password policies (vulnerability), hackers attempt credential stuffing (threat), it could lead to data breaches (impact).

⚙ Why manage risk?
To protect:

Confidentiality (no unauthorized access)

Integrity (data isn’t tampered)

Availability (systems stay up)

To ensure trust & compliance.

To minimize financial losses.

🔄 Risk management lifecycle
Identify: What assets exist? What threats & vulnerabilities?

Assess: What’s the likelihood × impact?

Mitigate: Apply controls to reduce risk to acceptable level.

Monitor & Review: Security posture evolves, so repeat.

🔄 Continuous improvement is key. Risks change as business changes.

✅ Module 2: Conducting a Risk Assessment
🔎 What is a risk assessment?
It’s a formal process to understand the risk landscape.

Helps prioritize security actions based on risk levels.

📋 Steps in a typical risk assessment
Step	Explanation
Identify assets	What needs protection? Servers, data, people
Identify threats	Hackers, malware, insider threats, disasters
Identify vulnerabilities	Weak passwords, old software, open ports
Assess likelihood & impact	e.g., high probability + severe damage
Prioritize risks	Focus first on high probability & impact
Recommend controls	Fix with security measures

⚖ Example assessment summary
Asset	Threat	Vulnerability	Risk Level	Control
Customer DB	SQLi	Poor input checks	High	Use parameterized queries
Employee emails	Phishing	Lack of training	Medium	Run awareness campaigns
Server uptime	Power loss	No backup power	Low	Install UPS systems

✅ Module 3: SIEM Tools & Dashboards
🛠 What is a SIEM?
SIEM stands for Security Information and Event Management.

Collects logs & security data from across organization (servers, firewalls, endpoints).

Analyzes events to detect threats in real-time.

Correlates events for suspicious patterns (like repeated failed logins).

Produces dashboards, alerts, reports.

🖥️ What does a SIEM dashboard show?
Typical panels	Examples
Auth events	Logins, failed attempts
Network traffic anomalies	Suspicious spikes
Malware detections	Endpoint antivirus logs
File integrity changes	Files modified on sensitive dirs
User activity	New admin accounts created

Helps security teams answer questions like:

Are we under brute force attack?

Who accessed which files yesterday?

Is malware spreading across machines?

🚀 Popular SIEM tools
Splunk: Very common, commercial, powerful dashboards.

IBM QRadar: Used by many enterprises.

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana): Open source option.

AlienVault OSSIM: Open source SIEM with asset discovery.

Graylog: Another popular log management tool.

📝 Benefits of SIEM
✅ Central visibility over huge environments.
✅ Automated correlation: ties together login failures + network scans + malware alerts.
✅ Fast alerting, better incident response.
✅ Regulatory compliance reports (for PCI, HIPAA, etc).

✅ Module 4: Phases of Incident Response
🚨 Why incident response (IR)?
Because no system is perfectly secure — so you must be prepared for breaches.

"It’s not IF you get attacked, it’s WHEN."

🧭 Typical incident response phases
🚦 1. Preparation
Create incident response policies & run tabletop exercises.

Train staff how to detect and report incidents.

🔍 2. Detection & Analysis
Security tools (SIEM, IDS) raise alerts.

Analysts triage:

Is it a real incident?

What’s scope, impact, affected systems?

🛠 3. Containment, Eradication & Recovery
Containment: isolate affected machines, block malicious IPs.

Eradication: remove malware, close vulnerabilities.

Recovery: restore systems from backups, validate they’re clean.

📈 4. Post-Incident Activity
Document incident & lessons learned.

Adjust defenses to prevent repeat attacks.

📚 Real examples of IR activities
IR Stage	Activities
Preparation	Write playbooks, conduct phishing drills
Detection	SIEM alert on unusual logins
Containment	Disable compromised accounts
Eradication	Patch exploited vulnerability, remove backdoors
Recovery	Reinstall servers, restore from clean backup
Post-Incident	Update signatures, improve detection rules

✅ Takeaways from Course 2
✔ You can perform risk assessments and prioritize risks.
✔ You understand security controls: preventive, detective, corrective.
✔ You know what SIEMs are and how they help.
✔ You grasp the phases of incident response.
